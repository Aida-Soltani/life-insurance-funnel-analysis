Strategic hypotheses and recommendations for product and marketing teams to optimize revenue efficiency.

## ðŸ”„ Funnel Step Definitions

**Started_navigator**  : first step in the product funnel and everyone in this dataset sees this step.

**Collect_contact_info** : this is where we ask for an email and phone number for identification and marketing purposes.

**Viewed_quotes** : After presenting contact info, we are able to show customers quotes for life insurance. This is the first place they see pricing.

**Application_submit** : After seeing quotes, customers can submit applications to move forward with their quotes.

**Phone_connect** : Once a customer submits an application, the app is routed to a live insurance agent to call them and collect more detailed information to move them forward with the life insurance process.

**Sign_and_exam**   For this purpose, this is the last step to analyze. This represents acustomer moving forward the life insurance process and scheduling a medical exam.
